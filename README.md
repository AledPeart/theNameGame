# theNameGame

theNameGame is a picture naming web application, which helps people affected by aphasia to practice and improve their language finding abilities.

## __Table of Contents__

## Aims of the project

The aim of this project is to build a picture naming game, which specifically helps people affected by expressive dysphasia to practice and improve their language finding abilities. The project will consider the needs of the patient/user and of the therapist/owner and their respective desired outcomes. 

The user will be asked to name a series of common objects. If a user is unable to identify the object initially they will be given a series of prompts or clues in order to help them. At the end of the task the user will receive a score showing how many correct and incorrect answers they achieved. The owner will be also be able to access the score, and importantly information showing the prompts required by the user.

## What is Aphasia
Aphasia is a language and communication disorder, which affects the language centers of the brain. The most common cause is a stroke, but it can be also result from a head injury, brain tumor and other neurological illnesses.
Expressive dysphasia is a form of aphasia that affects a person’s ability to express what they want to say. Sufferers will often liken it to having a word on the ‘tip of your tongue’, but being unable to recall it. (www.stroke.org.uk)



## User Experience

Here I will address the aims and goals of the website from both the perspectives of the user/patient and of the owner/therapist. I will also address how user experience is key to the design of the website.

### User stories

* As a user I want to access a fully functioning web application that enables me to practice and improve my word finding strategies

* As a user I want the web application to be clear and uncluttered and present information to me in a cohesive manner.

* As a user I want the web application to use icons and colors to help my understanding of what is required.

* As a user I want to be shown a number of clear well presented images for me to identify.

* As a user I want to be able to input my answer using the computer keyboard.

* As a user I want to be offered some additional prompts if I am struggling to name an object.

* As a user I want to receive clear confirmation if my answer is correct or incorrect and see my score as I progress through the game.

* As a user I want to receive clear instructions on how the game works

* As a user I want to be able to refresh the game and start again

* As a user I want to be able to 'mute' the sound during the game

### Owner stories

* As the owner I want to test the users word retrieval.

* As the owner I want the user to be shown a series of ‘high frequency nouns’

* As the owner I want the user to be offered some additional prompts if they are unable to name an object.

* As the owner I want the additional prompts offered to the user to be both visual and auditory.

* As the owner I want to receive the users overall score on completing the game.

* As the owner I want a breakdown of the users correct and incorrect answers.

* As the owner I want a breakdown of the additional prompts given to the user in order to assess which neural pathways the user was having difficulty with.


### Design Objectives

Consideration is given to the fact that users of the game will have suffered some form of neural damage and may find navigating and distinguishing some items and words within the app especially difficult. With this in mind the design will aim to achieve the following:


* A clear, well thought out design, which is clean intuitive, and uncluttered.

* Has clearly defined areas.

* Uses high contrast colors to aid visual clarity

* Icons and symbols used to reinforce text e.g ✓  and  ✗ 

* Colors used to add meaning, and provide visual feedback to users e.g. green for correct, red for incorrect.

* The selected picture objects are to be high frequency nouns, in other words everyday objects that the user will be familiar with. e.g. cat, tree, car etc. There should be no ambiguity concerning the naming of the object.

* The picture objects to appear in a clearly defined box/frame against a white background to enhance their clarity.

* Any audio files used will be clear and concise.

* Language and instructions to be clear and unambigious.

### UX Design Goals

*	Responsive mobile first design – looks equally good on a mobile and across all devices.

*	Accessibility – content is accessible to as many users as possible – clear text, sufficiently contrasted to the background, ‘alt’ tags and ‘aria’ labels used appropriately.

*	Simple, flowing design, with a clear purpose.

*	Design adheres to current norms and conventions e.g clear navigation icons.

## Design Layout and Features

I made a decision to use as much 'vanilla' Javascript as possible when building this game. I felt that I had a better understanding of JQuery but that I had was not fully comfortable with some of the fundamental syntax and core concepts, so I saw this a great opportunity to re-enforce the learning from the preceding course modules and bolster my understanding. I opted to use Bootstrap as much as possible in order to ensure my design and build were consistent and responsive.

### Start Page
* Upon loading the game the user will be presented with an introductory/start page. This page will display the game logo and will have some text to welcome users to the site. There will also be a short paragraph to explain a little bit about aphasia as well as how the game works and how it can help people who are affected by aphasia. In order to begin the game users will be asked to enter their name, which will be used during the game to display their score on the scoreboard. This input field will be validated and require that a name is entered. It will not accept numbers or only blank spaces, and users will be alerted if they have not met those conditions. When the conditions have been met the user will be taken to the main game page. In an attempt to keep the design as simple and straightforward as possible I wanted to keep this as a one page application and have therefore used Javascript and CSS to display and hide sections of my page as required.
